# Ruconnect
A handy tool made to control multiple devices one at the time using the terminal.

### How it works
The tool works by letting each device act like a client by connecting them to you and wait for your command,
you only have to type the command once and the script will send it to every device, you will then receive their response.

### Usage
Start client: `ruby client.rb`
Start host: `ruby host.rb`

### Observe
You need to start the host before you can start clients.
